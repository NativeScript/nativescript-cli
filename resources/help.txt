--[create]--

Usage:
    $ tns create <App name> [--path <Directory>] [--appid <App ID>] [--copy-from <Directory>]

Creates a new NativeScript project.
<App name> is the name of project. The specified name must comply with the limitations of the target platform. 
           For example, the name of a project that targets Android must not begin with a number because classes in Java
           cannot begin with numbers.

Options:
    --path - Specifies the directory where you want to create the project, if different from the current directory.
            The directory must be empty.
    --appid - Sets the application identifier for your project. The application identifier must consist of at least three
              alphanumeric strings, separated by a dot (.). Each string must start with a letter.
              The application identifier corresponds to the Bundle ID for iOS apps and to the package identifier for Android apps.
              If not specified, the application identifier is set to com.telerik.<App name>.
    --copy-from - Specifies a directory which contains custom assets that you want to use in your NativeScript project. If not set,
                  the default hello-world template is used.

--[platform|add]--

Usage:
    $ tns platform add <Platform>

Platform-specific usage:
    $ tns platform add android
    $ tns platform add ios

Configures the current project to target the selected platform. In this version of Telerik NativeScript, 
you can target iOS and Android, based on your system. You need to have your system configured for development with the target 
platform.
On Windows systems, you can target Android. 
On OS X systems, you can target Android and iOS.

When you add a target platform, the Telerik NativeScript CLI adds a corresponding platform-specific subdirectory under the platforms
directory. This platform-specific directory contains the necessary files to let you build your project for the target platform.

--[prepare]--

Usage:
    $ tns prepare [<Platform>]

Platform-specific usage:
    $ tns prepare android
    $ tns prepare ios

the SDK for the selected platform.

--[build]--

Usage:
    $ tns build [<platform>]

Platform-specific usage:
    $ tns build android
    $ tns build ios

in the project.
