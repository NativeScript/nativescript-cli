Configures the current project to target the selected platform. 

<File Path> is the complete path to a valid npm package or a directory that contains a NativeScript runtime for the selected platform. 

When you add a target platform, the NativeScript CLI adds a corresponding platform-specific subdirectory under the platforms directory. This platform-specific directory contains the necessary files to let you build your project for the target platform.

In this version of the NativeScript CLI, you can target iOS and Android, based on your system. You need to have your system configured for development with the target platform.
On Windows and Linux systems, you can target Android. 
On OS X systems, you can target Android and iOS.

    --frameworkPath - Sets the path to a NativeScript runtime for the specified platform that you want to use instead of the default runtime.
        If --symlink is specified, <File Path> must point to directory in which the runtime is already extracted. 
        If --symlink is not specified, <File Path> must point to a valid npm package. 
    --symlink - Creates a symlink to a NativeScript runtime for the specified platform that you want to use instead of the default runtime.
        If --frameworkPath is specified, creates a symlink to the specified directory.
