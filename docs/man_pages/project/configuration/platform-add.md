# ns platform add

### Description

Configures the current project to target the selected platform. <% if(isHtml) { %>When you add a target platform, the NativeScript CLI creates a corresponding platform-specific subdirectory under the platforms directory. This platform-specific directory contains the necessary files to let you build your project for the target platform.<% } %>

### Commands

Usage | Synopsis
