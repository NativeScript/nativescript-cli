# tns deploy

### Description

Prepares, builds and deploys the project to a connected device or native emulator. <% if(isMacOS) { %>You must specify the target platform on which you want to deploy.<% } %> It will deploy the app on all connected devices targeting the selected platform.

<% if(isMacOS) { %>
<% if(isHtml) { %>> <% } %>IMPORTANT: Before building for iOS device, verify that you have configured a valid pair of certificate and provisioning profile on your macOS system. <% if(isHtml) { %>For more information, see the [Code Signing](https://developer.apple.com/support/code-signing/) and [Maintain Signing Assets](https://help.apple.com/xcode/mac/current/#/dev3a05256b8) sections from the Apple Developer documentation.<% } %>

### Commands

Usage | Synopsis
---|---
Deploy on Android | `$ tns deploy android [--device <Device ID>] [--key-store-path <File Path> --key-store-password <Password> --key-store-alias <Name> --key-store-alias-password <Password>] [--release] [--aab]`
<% if(isMacOS) { %>Deploy on iOS | `$ tns deploy ios [--device <Device ID>] [--release]`<% } %>

### Options for iOS

* `--device` - Deploys the project on the specified connected physical or virtual device. `<Device ID>` is the index or name of the target device as listed by the `$ tns devices` command.
* `--release` - If set, produces a release build. Otherwise, produces a debug build.<% } %>

### Options<% if(isMacOS) { %> for Android<% } %>

* `--device` - Deploys the project on the specified connected physical or virtual device. `<Device ID>` is the index or name of the target device as listed by the `$ tns devices` command.
* `--clean` - If set, forces the complete rebuild of the native application.
* `--release` - If set, produces a release build. Otherwise, produces a debug build. When set, you must also specify the `--key-store-*` options.
* `--key-store-path` - Specifies the file path to the keystore file (P12) which you want to use to code sign your APK. You can use the `--key-store-*` options along with `--release` to produce a signed release build. You need to specify all `--key-store-*` options.
* `--key-store-password` - Provides the password for the keystore file specified with `--key-store-path`. You can use the `--key-store-*` options along with `--release` to produce a signed release build. You need to specify all `--key-store-*` options.
* `--key-store-alias` - Provides the alias for the keystore file specified with `--key-store-path`. You can use the `--key-store-*` options along with `--release` to produce a signed release build. You need to specify all `--key-store-*` options.
* `--key-store-alias-password` - Provides the password for the alias specified with `--key-store-alias-password`. You can use the `--key-store-*` options along with `--release` to produce a signed release build. You need to specify all `--key-store-*` options.
* `--env.*` - Specifies additional flags that the bundler may process. Can be passed multiple times. Supported additional flags:
    *   `--env.aot` - creates Ahead-Of-Time build (Angular only).
    *   `--env.snapshot`- creates [a V8 Snapshot](https://docs.nativescript.org/performance-optimizations/bundling-with-webpack#v8-heap-snapshot) decreasing the app start time (only for release builds for Android).
    *   `--env.compileSnapshot`- compiles the static assets produced by `--env.snapshot` into `.so` files allowing the native build to split them per architecture. This will reduce the app size when using the `--aab` option. 
    *   `--env.uglify` - provides basic obfuscation and smaller app size.
    *   `--env.report` - creates a Webpack report inside a `report` folder in the root folder.
    *   `--env.sourceMap` - creates inline source maps.
    *   `--env.hiddenSourceMap` - creates sources maps in the root folder (useful for Crashlytics usage with bundled app in release).
* `--aab` - Specifies that the command will produce and deploy an Android App Bundle.
* `--force` - If set, skips the application compatibility checks and forces `npm i` to ensure all dependencies are installed. Otherwise, the command will check the application compatibility with the current CLI version and could fail requiring `tns migrate`.

### Command Limitations

* You can run `$ tns deploy ios` only on macOS systems.
* When the `--release` flag is set for an Android build, you must also specify all `--key-store-*` options.
