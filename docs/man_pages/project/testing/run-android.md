# tns run android

### Description

Runs your project on a connected Android device or Android emulator, if configured. This is shorthand for prepare, build and deploy. While your app is running, prints the output from the application in the console and watches for changes in your code. Once a change is detected, it synchronizes the change with all selected devices and restarts/refreshes the application.

When running this command without passing `--release` flag, the HMR (Hot Module Replacement) is enabled by default. In case you want to disable HMR, you can pass `--no-hmr` flag. When `--release` is passed, CLI disables HMR.

### Commands

Usage | Synopsis
---|---
Run on all connected devices and running emulators | `$ tns run android [--key-store-path <File Path> --key-store-password <Password> --key-store-alias <Name> --key-store-alias-password <Password>] [--release] [--justlaunch] [--env.*]] [--aab]`
Run on a selected connected device or running emulator. Will start emulator with specified `Device Identifier`, if not already running. | `$ tns run android --device <Device ID> [--key-store-path <File Path> --key-store-password <Password> --key-store-alias <Name> --key-store-alias-password <Password>] [--release] [--justlaunch] [--env.*]] [--aab]`
Start a default emulator if none are running, or run application on all connected emulators. | `$ tns run android --emulator [--key-store-path <File Path> --key-store-password <Password> --key-store-alias <Name> --key-store-alias-password <Password>] [--release] [--justlaunch] [--env.*]] [--aab]`

### Options

* `--nsconfig` - If set, all the options below can be defined in the [nsconfig.json file](https://docs.nativescript.org/core-concepts/project-structure-app#the-nsconfigjson-file) at the root of your project. In the `nsconfig.json` file, you need to add the `tnsOptions` key with the `android` subkey.
* `--device` - Specifies a connected device or emulator to start and run the app. `<Device ID>` is the index or `Device Identifier` of the target device as listed by the `$ tns device android --available-devices` command.
* `--emulator` - If set, runs the app in all available and configured Android emulators. It will start an emulator if none are already running.
* `--justlaunch` - If set, does not print the application output in the console.
* `--clean` - If set, forces the complete rebuild of the native application.
* `--no-watch` - If set, changes in your code will not be reflected during the execution of this command.
* `--release` - If set, produces a release build by running webpack in production mode and native build in release mode. Otherwise, produces a debug build. When set, you must also specify the --key-store-* options.
* `--key-store-path` - Specifies the file path to the keystore file (P12) which you want to use to code sign your APK. You can use the `--key-store-*` options along with `--release` to produce a signed release build. You need to specify all `--key-store-*` options.
* `--key-store-password` - Provides the password for the keystore file specified with `--key-store-path`. You can use the `--key-store-*` options along with `--release` to produce a signed release build. You need to specify all `--key-store-*` options.
* `--key-store-alias` - Provides the alias for the keystore file specified with `--key-store-path`. You can use the `--key-store-*` options along with `--release` to produce a signed release build. You need to specify all `--key-store-*` options.
* `--key-store-alias-password` - Provides the password for the alias specified with `--key-store-alias-password`. You can use the `--key-store-*` options along with `--release` to produce a signed release build. You need to specify all `--key-store-*` options.
* `--no-hmr` - Disables Hot Module Replacement (HMR). In this case, when a change in the code is applied, CLI will transfer the modified files and restart the application.
* `--env.*` - Specifies additional flags that the bundler may process. Can be passed multiple times. 
    *   `--env.aot` - creates Ahead-Of-Time build (Angular only).
    *   `--env.snapshot`- creates [a V8 Snapshot](https://docs.nativescript.org/performance-optimizations/bundling-with-webpack#v8-heap-snapshot) decreasing the app start time (only for release builds for Android).
    *   `--env.compileSnapshot`- compiles the static assets produced by `--env.snapshot` into `.so` files allowing the native build to split them per architecture. This will reduce the app size when using the `--aab` option. 
    *   `--env.uglify` - provides basic obfuscation and smaller app size.
    *   `--env.report` - creates a Webpack report inside a `report` folder in the root folder.
    *   `--env.sourceMap` - creates inline source maps.
    *   `--env.hiddenSourceMap` - creates sources maps in the root folder (useful for Crashlytics usage with bundled app in release).
* `--aab` - Specifies that the command will produce and deploy an Android App Bundle.
* `--force` - If set, skips the application compatibility checks and forces `npm i` to ensure all dependencies are installed. Otherwise, the command will check the application compatibility with the current CLI version and could fail requiring `tns migrate`.

### Prerequisites

Before running your app in the Android emulator from the Android SDK, verify that your system meets the following requirements.
* Verify that you have installed the Android SDK.
* Verify that you have added the following Android SDK directories to the `PATH` environment variable:
    * `platform-tools`
    * `tools`

### Command Limitations

* You cannot use the `--device` and `--emulator` options simultaneously.
* When the `--release` flag is set, you must also specify all `--key-store-*` options.
