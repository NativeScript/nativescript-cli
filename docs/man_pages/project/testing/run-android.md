run android
==========

Usage | Synopsis
---|---
Run on all connected devices and running emulators | `$ tns run android [--key-store-path <File Path> --key-store-password <Password> --key-store-alias <Name> --key-store-alias-password <Password>] [--release] [--justlaunch]`
Run on a selected connected device or running emulator. Will start emulator with specified `Device Identifier`, if not already running. | `$ tns run android --device <Device ID> [--key-store-path <File Path> --key-store-password <Password> --key-store-alias <Name> --key-store-alias-password <Password>] [--release] [--justlaunch]`
Start a default emulator if none are running, or run application on all connected emulators. | `$ tns run android --emulator [--key-store-path <File Path> --key-store-password <Password> --key-store-alias <Name> --key-store-alias-password <Password>] [--release] [--justlaunch]`

Runs your project on a connected Android device or in a native Android emulator, if configured. This is shorthand for prepare, build and deploy. While your app is running, prints the output from the application in the console and watches for changes in your code. Once a change is detected, it synchronizes the change with all selected devices and restarts/refreshes the application.

### Options
* `--device` - Specifies a connected device/emulator to start and run the app.
* `--emulator` - If set, runs the app in all available and configured android emulators. It will start an emulator if none are already running.
* `--justlaunch` - If set, does not print the application output in the console.
* `--clean` - If set, forces rebuilding the native application.
* `--no-watch` - If set, changes in your code will not be reflected during the execution of this command.
* `--release` - If set, produces a release build. Otherwise, produces a debug build. When set, you must also specify the `--key-store-*` options.
* `--key-store-path` - Specifies the file path to the keystore file (P12) which you want to use to code sign your APK. You can use the `--key-store-*` options along with `--release` to produce a signed release build. You need to specify all `--key-store-*` options.
* `--key-store-password` - Provides the password for the keystore file specified with `--key-store-path`. You can use the `--key-store-*` options along with `--release` to produce a signed release build. You need to specify all `--key-store-*` options.
* `--key-store-alias` - Provides the alias for the keystore file specified with `--key-store-path`. You can use the `--key-store-*` options along with `--release` to produce a signed release build. You need to specify all `--key-store-*` options.
* `--key-store-alias-password` - Provides the password for the alias specified with `--key-store-alias-password`. You can use the `--key-store-*` options along with `--release` to produce a signed release build. You need to specify all `--key-store-*` options.

### Attributes
* `<Device ID>` is the index or `Device Identifier` of the target device as listed by `$ tns device android --available-devices`

### Prerequisites:
Before running your app in the Android emulator from the Android SDK, verify that your system meets the following requirements.
* Verify that you have installed the Android SDK.
* Verify that you have added the following Android SDK directories to the `PATH` environment variable:
    * `platform-tools`
    * `tools`

### Command Limitations

* You cannot use `--device` and `--emulator` simultaneously.
* When the `--release` flag is set, you must also specify all `--key-store-*` options.
