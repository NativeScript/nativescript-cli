run ios
==========

Usage | Synopsis
---|---
Run on all connected devices | `$ tns run ios [--release] [--justlaunch]`
Run on a selected connected device. Will start simulator with specified `Device Identifier`, if not already running. | `$ tns run ios [--device <Device ID>] [--release] [--justlaunch]`
Start an emulator and run the app inside it | `$ tns run ios --emulator [--release]`

Runs your project on a connected iOS device or in the iOS Simulator, if configured. This is shorthand for prepare, build and deploy. While your app is running, prints the output from the application in the console and watches for changes in your code. Once a change is detected, it synchronizes the change with all selected devices and restarts/refreshes the application.

### Options
* `--device` - Specifies a connected device/simulator to start and run the app.
* `--emulator` - If set, runs the app in all available and configured ios simulators. It will start a simulator if none are already running.
* `--justlaunch` - If set, does not print the application output in the console.
* `--clean` - If set, forces rebuilding the native application.
* `--no-watch` - If set, changes in your code will not be reflected during the execution of this command.
* `--release` - If set, produces a release build. Otherwise, produces a debug build.

### Attributes
* `<Device ID>` is the index or `Device Identifier` of the target device as listed by `$ tns device ios --available-devices`

### Prerequisites
Before running the iOS Simulator, verify that you have met the following requirements.
* You have installed Xcode. The version of Xcode must be compatible with the ios-sim-portable npm package on which the  NativeScript CLI depends. For more information, visit [https://www.npmjs.org/package/ios-sim-portable](https://www.npmjs.org/package/ios-sim-portable).

### Command Limitations

* You can run `$ tns run ios` only on OS X systems.
* You cannot use `--device` and `--emulator` simultaneously.
