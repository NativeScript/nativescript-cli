# tns test ios

### Description

Runs the tests in your project on connected iOS devices or the iOS Simulator.<% if(isConsole && isMacOS) { %> Your project must already be configured for unit testing by running `$ tns test init`.<% } %>

<% if(isConsole && (isLinux || isWindows)) { %>WARNING: You can run this command only on macOS systems. To view the complete help for this command, run `$ tns help test ios`<% } %> 

### Commands

Usage | Synopsis
------|-------
Run tests on all connected devices | `$ tns test ios [--watch] [--debug-brk]`
Run tests on a selected device | `$ tns test ios --device <Device ID> [--watch] [--debug-brk]`
Run tests in the iOS Simulator | `$ tns test ios --emulator [--watch] [--debug-brk]`

<% if((isConsole && isMacOS) || isHtml) { %>

### Options

* `--nsconfig` - If set, all the options below can be defined in the [nsconfig.json file](https://docs.nativescript.org/core-concepts/project-structure-app#the-nsconfigjson-file) at the root of your project. In the `nsconfig.json` file, you need to add the `tnsOptions` key with the `ios` subkey.
* `--watch` - If set, when you save changes to the project, changes are automatically synchronized to the connected device and tests are re-ran.
* `--device` - Specifies the serial number or the index of the connected device on which you want to run tests. To list all connected devices, grouped by platform, run `$ tns device`. You cannot set `--device` and `--emulator` simultaneously. `<Device ID>` is the device index or identifier as listed by the `$ tns device` command.
* `--emulator` - Runs tests on the iOS Simulator. You cannot set `--device` and `--emulator` simultaneously.
* `--debug-brk` - Runs the tests under the debugger. The debugger will break just before your tests are executed, so you have a chance to place breakpoints.
* `--force` - If set, skips the application compatibility checks and forces `npm i` to ensure all dependencies are installed. Otherwise, the command will check the application compatibility with the current CLI version and could fail requiring `tns migrate`.
