# tns build ios

### Description

Builds the project for iOS and produces an `APP` or `IPA` that you can manually deploy in the iOS Simulator or on a device.

<% if(isConsole && (isWindows || isLinux)) { %>WARNING: You can run this command only on macOS systems. To view the complete help for this command, run `$ tns help build ios`<% } %>
<% if((isConsole && isMacOS) || isHtml) { %>
<% if(isHtml) { %>> <% } %>IMPORTANT: Before building for iOS device, verify that you have configured a valid pair of certificate and provisioning profile on your macOS system. <% if(isHtml) { %>For more information, see the [Code Signing](https://developer.apple.com/support/code-signing/) and [Maintain Signing Assets](https://help.apple.com/xcode/mac/current/#/dev3a05256b8) sections from the Apple Developer documentation.<% } %>

### Commands

Usage | Synopsis
---|---
General | `$ tns build ios [--for-device] [--release] [--copy-to <File Path>] [--provision [<UUID/name>]] [--env.*]]`

### Options

* `--release` - If set, produces a release build. Otherwise, produces a debug build.
* `--for-device` - If set, produces an application package that you can deploy on device. Otherwise, produces a build that you can run only in the native iOS Simulator.
* `--i-cloud-container-environment` - If set, adds the passed `iCloudContainerEnvironment` when exporting an application package with the `--for-device` option.
* `--copy-to` - Specifies the file path where the built `.ipa` will be copied. If it points to a non-existent directory path, it will be created. If the specified value is existing directory, the original file name will be used.
* `--team-id` - If used without parameter, lists all team names and ids. If used with team name or id, it will switch to automatic signing mode and configure the .xcodeproj file of your app. In this case .xcconfig should not contain any provisioning/team id flags. This team id will be further used for codesigning the app. For Xcode 9.0+, xcodebuild will be allowed to update and modify automatically managed provisioning profiles.
* `--provision` - If used without parameter, lists all eligible provisioning profiles. If used with UUID or name of your provisioning profile, it will switch to manual signing mode and configure the .xcodeproj file of your app. In this case xcconfig should not contain any provisioning/team id flags. This provisioning profile will be further used for codesigning the app.
* `--env.*` - Specifies additional flags that the bundler may process. Can be passed multiple times. Supported additional flags:
    *   `--env.aot` - creates Ahead-Of-Time build (Angular only).
    *   `--env.uglify` - provides basic obfuscation and smaller app size.
    *   `--env.report` - creates a Webpack report inside a `report` folder in the root folder.
    *   `--env.sourceMap` - creates inline source maps.
    *   `--env.hiddenSourceMap` - creates sources maps in the root folder (useful for Crashlytics usage with bundled app in release).
* `--force` - If set, skips the application compatibility checks and forces `npm i` to ensure all dependencies are installed. Otherwise, the command will check the application compatibility with the current CLI version and could fail requiring `tns migrate`.
* `--path <Directory>` - Specifies the directory that contains the project. If not set, the project is searched for in the current directory and all directories above it.
