debug android
==========

Usage | Synopsis
---|---
Deploy on device, run the app start Chrome DevTools, and attach the debugger | `$ tns debug android`
Deploy on device, run the app and stop at the first code statement | `$ tns debug android --debug-brk [--device <Device ID>] [--debug-port <port>] [--timeout <timeout>]`
Deploy in the native emulator, run the app and stop at the first code statement | `$ tns debug android --debug-brk --emulator [<Emulator Options>] [--timeout <timeout>]`
Deploy in Genymotion, run the app and stop at the first code statement | `$ tns debug android --debug-brk --geny <Geny Name> [--timeout <timeout>]`
Attach the debug tools to a running app on device | `$ tns debug android --start [--device <Device ID>] [--debug-port <port>] [--timeout <timeout>]`
Attach the debug tools to a running app in the native emulator | `$ tns debug android --start --emulator [<Emulator Options>] [--timeout <timeout>]`
Attach the debug tools to a running app in Genymotion | `$ tns debug android --start --geny <Geny Name> [--print-app-output] [--timeout <timeout>]`
Livesync on device, run the app start Chrome DevTools, and attach the debugger | `$ tns debug android --no-rebuild`
Livesync on device, run the app and stop at the first code statement | `$ tns debug android --no-rebuild --debug-brk [--device <Device ID>] [--debug-port <port>] [--timeout <timeout>]`
Livesync in the native emulator, run the app and stop at the first code statement | `$ tns debug android --no-rebuild --debug-brk --emulator [<Emulator Options>] [--timeout <timeout>]`
Livesync in Genymotion, run the app and stop at the first code statement | `$ tns debug android --no-rebuild --debug-brk --geny <Geny Name> [--timeout <timeout>]`
Livesync on device/emulator, run the app, start and attach the debugger. Refresh everything automatically upon changes | `$ tns debug android --watch [--debug-brk]`
Detach the debug tools | `$ tns debug android --stop`

Debugs your project on a connected device, in a native emulator or in Genymotion.

### Options
* `--device` - Specifies a connected device on which to debug the app.
* `--emulator` - Specifies that you want to debug the app in the native Android emulator from the Android SDK.
* `--geny` - Specifies a Genymotion emulator on which you want to debug your app.
* `--debug-brk` - Prepares, builds and deploys the application package on a device or in an emulator, launches the Chrome DevTools of your Chrome browser and stops at the first code statement.
* `--start` - Attaches the debug tools to a deployed and running app.
* `--stop` - Detaches the debug tools.
* `--debug-port` - Sets a new port on which to attach the debug tools.
* `--timeout` - Sets the number of seconds that the NativeScript CLI will wait for the debugger to boot. If not set, the default timeout is 90 seconds.
* `--no-rebuild` - Livesyncs to device/emulator when possible. Otherwise builds and deploys the application.
* `--watch` - If set, when you save changes to the project, changes are automatically synchronized to the connected device and the debugger is restarted. This option is available only when using `--no-rebuild`.

### Attributes
* `<Device ID>` is the index or name of the target device as listed by `$ tns device`
* `<Port>` is an accessible port on the device to which you want to attach the debugging tools.
* `<Emulator Options>` is any valid combination of options as listed by `$ tns help emulate android`
* `<GenyName>` is the name of the Genymotion virtual device that you want to use as listed by `$ genyshell -c "devices list"`

###Prerequisites

* You must have Chrome installed on your system.<br/>If you are using a non-standard named Chrome app on an OS X system (for example, a nightly Canary update), you need to set this name in the `ANDROID_DEBUG_UI_MAC` setting in the NativeScript [config.json](file:///<%= #{config.getConfigPath(config)} %>).
