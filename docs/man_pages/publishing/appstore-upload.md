# ns appstore upload

### Description

Uploads project to iTunes Connect. The command either issues a production build and uploads it to iTunes Connect, or uses an already built package to upload.
The user will be prompted interactively for verification code when two-factor authentication enabled account is used. As on non-interactive console (CI), you will not be prompt for verification code. In this case, you need to generate a login session for your apple's account in advance using `ns apple-login` command. The generated value must be provided via the `--appleSessionBase64` option and is only valid for up to a month. Meaning you'll need to create a new session every month.

### Commands

Usage | Synopsis
---|---
Build and upload package | `$ ns appstore upload [<Apple ID> [<Password> [<Mobile Provisioning Profile Identifier> [<Code Sign Identity>]]]]]`
Upload package | `$ ns appstore upload [<Apple ID> [<Password>]] --ipa <Ipa File Path>`

### Options

* `--ipa` - If set, will use provided .ipa file instead of building the project.
* `--appleApplicationSpecificPassword` - Specifies the password for accessing the information you store in iTunes Transporter application.
* `--appleSessionBase64` - The session that will be used instead of triggering a new login each time NativeScript CLI communicates with Apple's APIs.

### Arguments

* `<Apple ID>` and `<Password>` are your credentials for logging into iTunes Connect.
* `<Mobile Provisioning Profile Identifier>` the identifier of the mobile provision(e.g. d5d40f61-b303-4fc8-aea3-fbb229a8171c) which will be used for building. This can easily be acquired through the iPhone Configuration Utility.
* `<Code Sign Identity>` the code sign identity which will be used for building. You can set it to something generic like 'iPhone Distribution' to let the build automatically detect a code sign identity.
