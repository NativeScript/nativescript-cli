5.0.0 (2018, November 1)
==

### Breaking

* Existing applications that are using older Android runtime (not 5.0.0 one), but are built with CLI 5.0.0, may experience some changes - until now CLI was always passing parameter to gradle `-PsupportVersion=26.0.0-alpha1`. As CLI no longer passes this version, the default one from build.gradle will be used (for example 27.0.1). Check [this issue](https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-cli/pull/3923) for more information. In case you want to use the old version in your application, add the following in your `app.gradle`:
```
project.ext.supportVersion = "26.0.0-alpha1"
```

* CLI will not allow building for iOS with Xcode 8 or below. Check [this issue](https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-cli/issues/3887) for more information.
* CLI no longer support macOS Sierra and below. In case you are using such OS, CLI will print error message on each command. It will not stop you, but certain features will not work and we will not investigate them. `tns debug ios --inspector` will not work on macOS Sierra and below.
* You will not be able to build applications for Android without installing Android SDK 28. You can install Android SDK 28 and build tools 28 by executing the following commands:
```
$ANDROID_HOME/tools/bin/sdkmanager "build-tools;28.0.1"
$ANDROID_HOME/tools/bin/sdkmanager "platforms;android-28"
```
* `tns create` command is interactive now. In case you are using it in CI environment where the shell is marked as TTY (Travis for example), the CI will hang as it will wait for selection. You can get back the old behavior by passing `--js`:  `tns create <name> --js`. In case the terminal is not interactive, CLI will use the old behavior. More information is available in [this issue](https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-cli/issues/3829).

### Breaking

`library add` command is deprecated and will be removed completely in one of our next releases (currently scheduled for 1.5).
You cannot create NativeScript plugins with Android native code using Eclipse projects. You need to import your Eclipse project into Android Studio, convert it to Gradle build and consume the produced AAR file.
You cannot use Apache Ant to create new projects for Android but you can continue build your existing Ant-based projects. Starting with NativeScript 1.3, Android builds require Gradle. Run `tns doctor` on the command line to learn more.
Building NativeScript projects for Android requires Android SDK 22, Android SDK Build-tools 22, Android Support Repository and ANDROID_HOME environment variable set. Run `android` to configure Android SDK.

### New

* [Implemented #600](https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-cli/issues/600): Added the `$ tns init` command. You can use it to initialize a NativeScript project for development. The command recreates or updates the `package.json` file of the project. You can then run `$ tns install` to install the platforms and dependencies described in the `package.json` file.
* [Implemented #587](https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-cli/issues/587): Added the `$ tns install` command. You can use it to quickly install all platforms and dependencies described in a `package.json` file.

### Fixed

* [Fixed #606](https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-cli/issues/606): The NativeScript CLI lets you run `<Platform>`-based commands on operating systems which do not support development for this platform. For example, you can run `$ tns build ios` on a Windows system.
* [Fixed #601](https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-cli/issues/601): The NativeScript CLI does not treat the dependencies of devDependencies as devDependencies.
* [Fixed #599](https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-cli/issues/599): The NativeScript CLI always creates a `tmp` directory in the current directory when you run any command and modifies the `package.json` file for the project.
* [Fixed #584](https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-cli/issues/584): The NativeScript CLI references the files in the project with their absolute paths instead of their relative paths. This might cause the project to stop working when transfered to another location and might cause issues with your application packages.
* [Fixed #578](https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-cli/issues/578): Platform-specific files in NativeScript plugins are not processed correctly. The NativeScript CLI copies them to the correct platform-specific directory but does not rename them correctly.
* [Fixed #520](https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-cli/issues/520): iOS resources from the `App_Resources` folder are not included in the native Xcode project and are not accessible in the application package.

### New

* [Implemented #551](https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-cli/issues/551): You can now develop for Android 5.1.1 (API Level 22). If you have this SDK installed on your system, the CLI will set it as the default target SDK when you run `$ tns platform add android`
* [Implemented #552](https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-cli/issues/552): You can now set the target Android SDK for your project by specifying the `--sdk ` option for `$ tns platform add android` operations.

### Fixed

* [Fixed #555](https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-cli/issues/555): In some cases, the CLI merges incorrectly the plugin platform-specific `AndroidManifest.xml` or `Info.plist` with the respective platform-specific configuration files from the project.
* [Fixed #567](https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-cli/issues/567): You cannot use npm as a package manager inside your project.
* [Fixed #569](https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-cli/issues/569): On some Windows systems, the CLI installation shows errors in the console.

### Breaking

* Replaced `.tnsproject` with `package.json` to let you use npm and work with custom plugins in your project.<br/>The first time you run any NativeScript command on an existing project, your `.tnsproject` file will be automatically transformed into a `package.json` file describing your project configuration and data. After this, make sure to commit and push your changes if you are using version control.<br/>After the transformation is complete, you can install and use custom NativeScript plugins inside your project.

### New

* [Implemented #510](https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-cli/issues/510): You can work with custom NativeScript plugins in your project. You can add a plugin from an npm package, a local folder, a URL or a `.tar.gz` file. For more information, run `$ tns help plugin`

* [Fixed #324](https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-cli/issues/324): When you run commands for the `ios` platform, the NativeScript CLI might show the following unrelated adb warning: `Unable to find adb in PATH. Default one from %s resources will be used.`
* [Fixed #309](https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-cli/issues/309): You cannot open the device log for streaming with the `tns device log` command.

	1. Manually move all files and folders from the inner `app` folder one level up inside the outer `app` folder.
	1. Remove the now empty inner `app` folder.
	1. Verify that your project structure reflects the structure described [here](https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-cli/blob/production/README.md#create-project).
