### Breaking

`library add` command is deprecated and will be removed completely in one of our next releases (currently scheduled for 1.5).
You cannot create NativeScript plugins with Android native code using Eclipse projects. You need to import your Eclipse project into Android Studio, convert it to Gradle build and consume the produced AAR file.
You cannot use Apache Ant to create new projects for Android but you can continue build your existing Ant-based projects. Starting with NativeScript 1.3, Android builds require Gradle. Run `tns doctor` on the command line to learn more.
Building NativeScript projects for Android requires Android SDK 22, Android SDK Build-tools 22, Android Support Repository and ANDROID_HOME environment variable set. Run `android` to configure Android SDK.

### New

* [Implemented #600](https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-cli/issues/600): Added the `$ tns init` command. You can use it to initialize a NativeScript project for development.

After this, make sure to commit and push your changes if you are using version control.<br/>After the transformation is complete, you can install and use custom NativeScript plugins inside your project.

### New

* [Implemented #510](https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-cli/issues/510): You can work with custom NativeScript plugins in your project. You can add a plugin from an npm package, a local folder, a URL or a `.tar.gz` file. For more information, run `$ tns help plugin`
