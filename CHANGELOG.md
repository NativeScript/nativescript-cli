### Breaking changes

* Applications can be build only with bundle workflow - in previous versions there were two ways to build your application - `bundle` and `legacy` workflow. With this release CLI allows building your app only in case you are using the bundle workflow. More information is available [in this blopost](https://www.nativescript.org/blog/the-future-of-building-nativescript-apps)
* With older CLI versions you were able to run `tns debug android` and continue debugging after the command exits. In this release, when CLI exits, it clears all used resources, so you will not be able to continue the debug session. More information is available in [this issue](https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-cli/issues/4219) for more information.
* `--syncAllFiles` option is not supported anymore - this option was added to force CLI to watch all files in `node_modules`. In 6.0 this is the default and only behavior - webpack watches all required files and CLI watches the `platforms` directories and `package.json` files of the plugins added as dependencies of the application.
* Drop support for Xcode versions below 10 - new features for iOS require the latest Xcode versions, so we decided to require at least Xcode 10 for building the applications
* Drop support for Node.js below 8 - Node.js 8 does not support [these version anymore](https://github.com/nodejs/Release) and so does our CLI. In case you are using such Node.js version, CLI will not allow you to execute any command, so you should upgrade to latest LTS version.
* `--platformTemplate` option has been deleted. More information can be found in [this issue](https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-cli/issues/4867).
* `tns init` command has been deleted
* `tns clean app` command has been deleted
* Improved plugin development workflow may require changes in your daily work when creating plugins. More information can be found in [this issue](https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-cli/issues/4865)
* When you pass `--release`, CLI will switch webpack in production mode. More information can be found in [this issue](https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-cli/issues/4497)
* CLI now forces sourceMap generation by default when building in debug mode. You can disable them by passing `--env.sourceMap false`. souceMaps are disabled by default in release builds, you can enable them by passing `--env.sourceMap`.

5.0.0 (2018, November 1)
==

### Breaking

* Existing applications that are using older Android runtime (not 5.0.0 one), but are built with CLI 5.0.0, may experience some changes - until now CLI was always passing parameter to gradle `-PsupportVersion=26.0.0-alpha1`. As CLI no longer passes this version, the default one from build.gradle will be used (for example 27.0.1). Check [this issue](https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-cli/pull/3923) for more information. In case you want to use the old version in your application, add the following in your `app.gradle`:
```
project.ext.supportVersion = "26.0.0-alpha1"
```

* CLI will not allow building for iOS with Xcode 8 or below. Check [this issue](https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-cli/issues/3887) for more information.
* CLI no longer support macOS Sierra and below. In case you are using such OS, CLI will print error message on each command. It will not stop you, but certain features will not work and we will not investigate them. `tns debug ios --inspector` will not work on macOS Sierra and below.
* You will not be able to build applications for Android without installing Android SDK 28. You can install Android SDK 28 and build tools 28 by executing the following commands:
```
$ANDROID_HOME/tools/bin/sdkmanager "build-tools;28.0.1"
$ANDROID_HOME/tools/bin/sdkmanager "platforms;android-28"
```
* `tns create` command is interactive now. In case you are using it in CI environment where the shell is marked as TTY (Travis for example), the CI will hang as it will wait for selection. You can get back the old behavior by passing `--js`:  `tns create <name> --js`. In case the terminal is not interactive, CLI will use the old behavior. More information is available in [this issue](https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-cli/issues/3829).

### Breaking

`library add` command is deprecated and will be removed completely in one of our next releases (currently scheduled for 1.5).
You cannot create NativeScript plugins with Android native code using Eclipse projects. You need to import your Eclipse project into Android Studio, convert it to Gradle build and consume the produced AAR file.
You cannot use Apache Ant to create new projects for Android but you can continue build your existing Ant-based projects. Starting with NativeScript 1.3, Android builds require Gradle. Run `tns doctor` on the command line to learn more.
Building NativeScript projects for Android requires Android SDK 22, Android SDK Build-tools 22, Android Support Repository and ANDROID_HOME environment variable set. Run `android` to configure Android SDK.

==

### New

* [Implemented #600](https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-cli/issues/600): Added the `$ tns init` command. You can use it to initialize a NativeScript project for development.

This might cause the project to stop working when transfered to another location and might cause issues with your application packages.
* [Fixed #578](https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-cli/issues/578): Platform-specific files in NativeScript plugins are not processed correctly. The NativeScript CLI copies them to the correct platform-specific directory but does not rename them correctly.
* [Fixed #520](https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-cli/issues/520): iOS resources from the `App_Resources` folder are not included in the native Xcode project and are not accessible in the application package.

### Breaking

* Replaced `.tnsproject` with `package.json` to let you use npm and work with custom plugins in your project.<br/>The first time you run any NativeScript command on an existing project, your `.tnsproject` file will be automatically transformed into a `package.json` file describing your project configuration and data. After this, make sure to commit and push your changes if you are using version control.<br/>After the transformation is complete, you can install and use custom NativeScript plugins inside your project.

### New

* [Implemented #510](https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-cli/issues/510): You can work with custom NativeScript plugins in your project. You can add a plugin from an npm package, a local folder, a URL or a `.tar.gz` file. For more information, run `$ tns help plugin`
* [Implemented #362](https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-cli/issues/362): You can use npm as package manager for your NativeScript projects.

* [Fixed #309](https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-cli/issues/309): You cannot open the device log for streaming with the `tns device log` command.
