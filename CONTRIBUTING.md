Before you submit a Pull Request, consider the following guidelines.

* Search <a href="https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-cli/pulls">GitHub</a> for an open or closed Pull Request that relates to your submission.
* Clone the repository.
```bash
    git clone git@github.com:NativeScript/nativescript-cli.git
```
* Initialize the submodule.
```bash
    git submodule init
```
* Fetch data from the submodule.
```bash
    git submodule update
```
* Make your changes in a new `git` branch. We use the <a href="http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/">Gitflow branching model</a> so you will have to branch from our master branch.
```bash
    git checkout -b my-fix-branch master
```
* Create your patch and include appropriate test cases.
* Build your changes locally.
```bash
    grunt
```
* Ensure all the tests pass.
```bash
    grunt test
```
* Ensure that your code passes the linter.
```bash
    grunt lint
```
* Commit your changes and create a descriptive commit message (the commit message is used to generate release notes).
```bash
    git commit -a
```
* Push your branch to GitHub.
```bash
    git push origin my-fix-branch
```
* In GitHub, send a Pull Request to nativescript-cli:master.
* If we suggest changes, you can modify your branch, rebase, and force a new push to your GitHub repository to update the Pull Request.
```bash
    git rebase master -i
    git push -f
```

That's it! Thank you for your contribution!

When the patch is reviewed and merged, you can safely delete your branch and pull the changes from the main (upstream) repository.

* Delete the remote branch on GitHub.
```bash
    git push origin --delete my-fix-branch
```
* Check out the master branch.
```bash
    git checkout master -f
```
* Delete the local branch.
```bash
    git branch -D my-fix-branch
```
* Update your master branch with the latest upstream version.
```
    git pull --ff upstream master
```

Updating the CLI documentation
===

The CLI documentation is what you see when running the `tns help` command. 
This documentation is distributed as part of the CLI package and is generated from the *.md files that can be found in <a href="https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-cli/tree/master/docs/man_pages" target="_blank">man_pages folder</a>
The output of the documentation is html static pages that are generated on post install hook of the CLI installation. 
In addition, documentation generation is triggered every time there is no html article for the respective help command that is executed.

In order to see a change applied in your development workspace after editing the *.md files, you can use the `tns dev-generate-help` command. 
This will trigger regeneration of all html files on your local environment. Mind that you need to run from the /bin folder of the nativescript_cli.
